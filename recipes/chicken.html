        <h2 class="head-sub">Description</h2>
            <p>Bring a light, smokey flavor to your oven-roasted chicken thighs without having to grill outdoors.</p>
            <p>The deep flavors pair well with a cucumber salad or garlic rice.</p>
        <h2 class="head-sub">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ancho chile powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
                <li>4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="head-sub">Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease an 8x8 baking dish.</li>
                <li>In a resealable storage bag, combine paprika,garlic, ancho chile powder, salt, tumeric, and black pepper; add olive oil and apple cider vinegar and mix together. Place chicken thighs into bag, reseal, and massage seasoning mix into chicken. Marinate, refridgerated, for at least 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish and drizzle with melted butter.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside and the skin is crispy, about 40 minutes, brushing occassionally with the pan drippings. An instant-read therometer insertedj into the thick part of a thigh should read at least 165 degrees. For extra crispy chicken place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
